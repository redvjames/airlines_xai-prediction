Airline passengers are the life and blood of the aviation industry, and passenger satisfaction is one of the top priorities airline businesses need to ensure their continued growth and success. In this study, we use the Explainable Boosting Machine to identify relevant features and extract key insights from US airline passenger data. The Explainable Boosting Machine is both a predictive model and an explainability model in one, and it can detect non-linear relationships such as interacting features. In addition to the global and local explanations provided by the Explainable Boosting Machine, we also use Diverse Counterfactual Explanations to provide passenger-level explanations. We identified three key features that determine passenger satisfaction based on global explanations, namely:

    In-flight wifi service,
    Passenger type, and
    Travel type.

To improve this study, we can perform a separate analysis on each travel type (business or personal) to obtain more granular insights on what each travel type customer finds important for their overall satisfaction. Since we successfully used the Explainable Boosting Machine to identify key features for passenger satisfaction, this model can also be used in industries that care about customer satisfaction.
